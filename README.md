# Composing an App with Free Monads (using Cats)

Code and slides for my talk on Free Monads

##  Abstract

In this talk I will explain what Free Monads are and how to use them (using the Cats implementation).

After having shown the basics I build a small app by composing several Free Monads to a small program.

I discuss the pros and cons of this technique.

Finally I will demonstrate how to avoid some boilerplate with the *FreeK* library.
